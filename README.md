# Travel Times

This repository contains three programs for calculating and generating coordinates and creating road networks. The travel_times.py program calculates the travel time between all pairs of points, the random_coordinates.py program generates random coordinates, and the create_network.py program creates a road network given a location.

## Requirements

To run these programs, you will need to install the following Python modules:

- osmnx
- numpy
- csv

You can install these modules using the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the random_coordinates.py program, use the following command:

`python random_coordinates.py`

To run the create_network.py program, use the following command:

`python create_network.py`

To run the travel_times.py program, use the following command:

`python travel_times.py` (need to be fixed)

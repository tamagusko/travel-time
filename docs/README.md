# create_network.py





# create_dummy_coordinates.py


# travel_times.py (need to be fixed)

This program is a tool for calculating the travel time between pairs of points using a road network data. It takes in the coordinates for the pairs of points and a file containing the road network data, and outputs the travel times between the pairs of points in a matrix. The program uses functions from several libraries to help it read and analyze the data, and perform the calculations. It then stores the results in a file for later use.

## Usage

1. Prepare two files: "coordinates.csv" (format: latitude, longitude) and "road_network.graphml (using create_network.py)"
2. Run command:  
`python travel_times.py`
